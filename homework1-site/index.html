    <p> Hi, I'm Zoe Chapman! I'm from Hawaii and I study data science and environmental science
      here at Northeastern University. I'm interested in GIS and environmental
      conservation. In my free time I like to run, rock climb, cook, and ski. 
      <p> If you want to learn more about my academic interests and career background, 
        check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zoe-chapman-899533227/">

      <p> In the future, I want to include the following on my website:
        <ul>
          <li>Examples of data science projects I've worked on in the past</li>
          <li>A link to my GitHub</li>
          <li>A button to be able to navigate between multiple pages </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
